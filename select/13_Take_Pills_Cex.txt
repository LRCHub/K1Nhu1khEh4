Eventually i'll have to take them
On my break if i don't shake less
Empty hands. the fire's left
They can't quite fight with their old strength
I'm so tired
I'm torn up
It's over now
You can make me normal

Your eyes are broken
You must lose them
Take the pills
Kill the delusions
You can't see it's adaquate
So swallow while you can be fixed

I havn't shaken in what feels like forever
I have let go of all my old obsessions
I am healthy. i am better
There's no more songs so when i'm dead and gone
I know it won't be the new me they rememeber
But i don't need my eyes to see
My eyes have only lied to me
Recognize the time for quitting
And your vision will outlive them all

Your eyes are broken
You must lose them
Take the pills
Kill the delusions
You can't see it's adaquate
So swallow while you can be fixed

Your eyes are broken
You must lose them
Take the pills
Kill the delusions
You can't see it's adaquate
So swallow while you can be fixed
