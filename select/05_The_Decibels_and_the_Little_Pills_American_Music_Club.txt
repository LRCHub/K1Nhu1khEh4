Decibels and little pills and all the thrills you steal from the moon
Holding hands with bright new
Friends names are only good for gravestones
Because he was sweet and so was she,
And you needed love to fill the dark
And time is a current that only flows from warm hands to warm hearts

No one here is going to save you
No one here is going to save you

In bed you said forever that the world would end if one of you let go
You woke up just in time for the sunset,
You said "Let's all go to the big rock show"
And in the bar when you were playing air
Guitar they suddenly vanished on their little clouds
And in this place you can't find a face
Without a trace of despair, or a shroud

No one here is going to save you
No one here is going to save you

And you pull off your blouse,
Wet girls gone wild, for a crowd that just didn't want to know
And it's not your scene, everyone is mean,
Your eyes they say, "I don't want to know"
And how sad is that,
Your rebel cowboy hat, all it says is you're tonight's casualty
Oh, and the crowd is proud to look away
Like they've never been desperate or lonely

No one here is going to save you
No one here is going to save you
No one here is going to save you
Where's the one that's going to save you?
